# Twitter Basics for Linguists

## Introduction

This workshop is a brief introduction to working with Twitter data using the `tweepy` python library. The example code and instructions were put together by Eric Wilbanks (EricWilbanks.github.io) for the Sociolinguistics Lab at Berkeley (http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/slab/) on October 28, 2020. If you have any questions about the code or troubleshooting issues, please contact me by email at *wilbanks.ericw at gmail.com*.


## Outline

This workshop will cover the basics for people interested in interacting with Twitter data via their API and Python. We'll work through some introductory examples on:

- Creating a Developer Account
- Making API requests and exporting data
- Visualizing basic information about tweets
- Basic Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzing geotagged tweets

## Requirements

This workshop was initially developed in `Python 3.8.6` and the `Twitter Api v1.1`. Additionally, it requires the following Python libraries:

1. os
1. csv
1. tweepy
1. pandas
1. matplotlib
1. nltk
1. geopandas
1. descartes

Most of the modules are distributed as Jupyter iPython notebooks (.ipynb). You can find more information about installing and using Jupyter notebooks at (https://jupyter.org/).

Because of Twitter Terms of Service, we won't be distributing the twitter corpora mentioned in the . Please find instructions for collecting comparable corpora in `01_querying_twitter.ipynb`.
